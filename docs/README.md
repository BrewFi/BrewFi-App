## 🎯 Project Overview

**CoffeeChain** is a decentralized loyalty rewards platform built on Avalanche that revolutionizes how coffee shops engage with customers.

### The Problem

- Limited interoperability

### The Solution
CoffeeChain uses blockchain technology to create:
- **Universal rewards** - One wallet, all coffee shops
- **Transparent rewards** - All transactions on-chain
- **Tradeable tokens** - $BREWFI can be traded or staked
- **Instant verification** - QR code redemption
