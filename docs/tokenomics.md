## Token Economics

### Supply Mechanics
- **Minting**: Controlled by DAO after initial distribution
- **Burning**: Automatic burn on NFT minting and redemptions
- **Target**: Deflationary after Year 3

### Price Stability
- Treasury can intervene during extreme volatility
- Liquidity locked for minimum 1 year
- Gradual unlock schedule prevents dumping

### Revenue Model
Coffee shops pay platform fee in BREWFI:
- 2% transaction fee on rewards distributed
- 50% burned, 50% to treasury
- Creates buy pressure and deflationary effect

## Liquidity Strategy

### Initial Liquidity (5M BREWFI)
- **Trader Joe**: 2.5M BREWFI + 10 AVAX
- **Pangolin**: 2.5M BREWFI + 10 AVAX
- Locked for 1 year minimum

### LP Rewards
- Provide BREWFI/AVAX liquidity → earn bonus BREWFI
- 5% APY for LP providers from treasury

## Governance Framework

### Proposal Threshold
- Minimum 50,000 BREWFI staked to create proposal
- 500,000 BREWFI quorum required for vote to pass
- 51% majority for standard proposals
- 66% supermajority for tokenomics changes

### Voting Power
- Based on staked BREWFI amount
- Lock period increases voting weight
- 3-month lock = 1.5x voting power
- 6-month lock = 2x voting power
